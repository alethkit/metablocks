Trivial inconveniences stack up quickly,prevent iteration

Top down block reduction was easier at first, but it did not scale.
Think in terms of smaller primitives first.

making a simpler IR was a good idea, but now figuring out a consistent serialisation
procedure for all blocks makes more sense (particularly if you want to extend it)

Typing with autocompletion (using the <datalist> element)
is more convenient than using a <select> dropdown box

The biggest trivial inconvenience so far is the CSS: easiest way to get out of a flow state

Unsurprisingly, having someone else to explain what you're working on helps in solidifying an
idea!

Drawing, sketches are very good (unless you actually have vivid mental imagery, in which case,
ignore this)
